# CitiBike-Repo
Machine Learning models fine tuning to improve rmse score on prediction of trip duration.

This dataset contains information about Citi bike rides in NYC including information about the destinations of bike ride, distance, and activity level at different bike stations. Given the large size of the datasets, I am focusing on only one month of data, October 2020. The goal of this dataset is to predict the trip duration of the ride.

Since 2013, a shared bicycle system, CitiBike, has been available in NYC. Citibike makes a vast amount of data available regarding system usage as sales of memberships and short-term passes. The data is stored month-wise, containing details of (almost) every trip, except the ones where the trip duration is under a minute.


Testing the changes right now. Test2.
